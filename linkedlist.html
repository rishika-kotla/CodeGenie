         <p>A linked list data structure includes a series of connected nodes. Here, each node store the data and the address of the next node.The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers as shown in the below image: </p>
        <img src="./Linkedlist (1).png" alt="" width="70%"> 
        <p class="ul-list-head">Each element in a linked list consists of two parts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Data:</b> This part stores the data value of the node. That is the information to be stored at the current node.
            </li>
            <li><b>Next Pointer:</b> This is the pointer variable or any other variable which stores the address of the next node in the memory.</li>
        </ul>  
        
        <p class="list-heading"><b>Advantages of Linked Lists over Arrays: </b>Arrays can be used to store linear data of similar types, but arrays have the following limitations:</p>
        <ol class="fun">
            <li>The size of the arrays is fixed, so we must know the upper limit on the number of elements in advance. Also, generally, the allocated memory is equal to the upper limit irrespective of the usage. On the other hand, linked lists are dynamic and the size of the linked list can be incremented or decremented during runtime.</li>
            <li>Inserting a new element in an array of elements is expensive, because a room has to be created for the new elements, and to create room, existing elements have to shift.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="list-heading"><b>Disadvantages of Linked Lists:</b></p>
        <ol class="fun">
            <li>Random access is not allowed in Linked Lists. We have to access elements sequentially starting from the first node. So, we cannot do a binary search with linked lists efficiently with its default implementation. Therefore, lookup or search operation is costly in linked lists in comparison to arrays.</li>
            <li>Extra memory space for a pointer is required with each element of the list.</li>
            <li>
                Not cache-friendly. Since array elements are present at contiguous locations, there is a locality of reference which is not there in the case of linked lists.  
            </li>
